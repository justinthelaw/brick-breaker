# Java Brick Breaker Game

A brick breaker game with a GUI that was started using this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9qMm3JbOH0. The purpose of this effort was to practice Java in a guided setting before further modifying the original source code. To test the game, export a `.jar` file or use the existing one and execute it using your JDK distribution.
